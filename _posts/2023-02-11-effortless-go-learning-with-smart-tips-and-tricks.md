I've been diving into Go for a few weeks, and I am constantly amazed by its simplicity.
As an experienced Java developer, I appreciate its concise and to-the-point syntax.

Go covers a wide range of functionality, from HTTP servers and network programming to cryptography.

I have adopted Go as my primary language for most of my side projects. I have invested time in reading a significant
amount of documentation to quickly become familiar with the Go ecosystem.

Today, I want to share some of it.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer looking to expand your skills, the following resources will help
you get started with Go.

## Official documentation

Check out the official resources provided by Google.

- [The official learning reference](https://go.dev/learn) for learning the basics
- [The official blog](https://go.dev/blog) for staying updated
- [The official documentation](https://go.dev/doc/) for reference

In addition, be sure to read [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go), which provides in-depth explanations of
Go's conventions and idioms.

## Books

If you prefer learning through reading, there are several great books on Go.
I highly recommend [Learning Go](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-go/9781492077206/) by Jon Bodner, which
offers a comprehensive introduction to Go programming with practical examples.

Another useful resource is the [Golang Book](https://www.golang-book.com/).

## Blogs

Alternatively, you can watch those tutorials on YouTube:

- [TechWorld with Nana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyUHQIec83I)
- [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS4e4q9oBaU)

And an interesting YouTube channel to follow: [GopherAcademy](https://www.youtube.com/@GopherAcademy/videos).

## Style

[The Google Go's Style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/index ) is an amazing resource to read, and you
will know how Go programmers at Google work.

Furthermore, you can read [this interesting post](https://kumojin.com/en/anatomy-golang-app-a-clean-architecture/) about
building an application with a clean architecture.

## Essential libraries

- [Testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify): a robust and flexible testing library for Go
- [Mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery): a tool for generating mock objects in Go
- [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin): a high-performance HTTP framework for Go

I also like to work with [this](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo) BDD-style testing library.

## IDEs

- [Goland](https://www.jetbrains.com/go)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

I hope this helps you on your Go journey. Stay tuned :)
