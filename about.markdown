I am an experienced full-stack software engineer based in Canada, fueled by a relentless passion for staying abreast of
the latest technologies and trends in software development, such as web development, mobile apps, and cloud services.

With diverse experience in a wide range of areas including full-stack engineering, cloud computing, Internet of
Things (IoT), mobile app development, blockchain technology, and infrastructure as code, I am well-equipped to deliver
exceptional results.

I am currently employed at [Ticketmaster](https://www.ticketmaster.com/) where I apply my expertise to a variety of
projects
including front-end
back-end development and DevOps, while also providing part-time freelance services to clients
in need of customized software solutions and consulting.

Outside the realm of technology, I enjoy a number of hobbies that nourish both my mind and body. These pursuits
include savoring a fine cup of coffee, venturing into the wilderness through hiking and outdoor activities, solving
intricate problems, honing my programming skills and delving into the complexities of architecture and system design.

These endeavors not only foster a healthy work-life balance, but also spark innovative ideas and perspectives that I can
into my professional endeavors as a full-stack software engineer.
