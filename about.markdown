As a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer based in Canada, I have a strong passion for learning new technologies and coding.

My areas of interest include full-stack engineering, cloud engineering, IoT, mobile, blockchain, and infrastructure as code.

I am currently employed at [Kumojin](https://kumojin.com/en/) and also offer my services as a part-time freelancer.
